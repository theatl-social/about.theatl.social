## Privacy and Security Advisory

- All content, including direct messages ("DM"s), posted to theATL.social Mastodon or Lemmy Instances should be considered public information that could be traced back to the content author.
- Due to the federated nature of Fediverse services, content is duplicated across multiple servers on an automatic basis. Even if a post is "deleted", it is almost certain that a copy of a post has been retained as a backup on a server.
- All reasonable efforts to protect personal data, including but not limited to email addresses, passwords, and client logs of IP addresses are taken. These efforts include encryption of data at rest and in transit.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the Mastodon or Lemmy software, virtual server providers, and/or other third-party providers may pose a risk of data exfiltration despite the reasonable efforts noted above.
- theATL.social services operate in the State of Georgia in the United States and are subject to Federal and State law. As such, in the event of lawful requests from authorities, theATL.social is required to provide requested any information.
- Users are permitted to utilize anonymous accounts and access via VPNs if they wish to hide their IP address or any other personal identification. However, theATL.social cannot provide any guarantees or of anonymity to users.


### Moderation and Operating Philosophy

- The operating philosophy of theATL.social is to provide an **open forum** where content may be posted by users without undue interference from instance moderators and administrators.

- The personal and/or political beliefs of moderators **should not interfere with users' ability** to post content, news, or links.

- **Server rules are clear and transparent.** Prohibitions against violence, hate speech, and trolling are intended to ensure the physical safety of users (and those individuals under discussion), promote civil discussions, and mitigate the likelhood of law enforcement involvement or inquiries in response to posted content.

  - Inauthentic accounts representing fictitious individuals or organizations. The creation of inauthentic accounts may include the use of scraped images/text to falsely establish identity.
  - Accounts created for malicious purposes or for purposes of abusing server resources through mass DMs or other related activities.

- Egregious examples of spam accounts will be subject to an immediate suspension. Upon suspension, the affected account will have the opportunity to appeal the suspension.


## Sunset Plan

### Required as per Mastodon Server Covenant

While all current plans for theATL.social are geared towards growth and expansion, there is also the unlikely possibility that in the future, circumstances would require the server to be shutdown.

In lieu of shutdown, server admins pledge to identify alternative server admins or owners.

However, should shutdown be unavoidable, server admins commit to providing at least, but not limited to, a three month (90 day) notice to current users of shutdown. This notice is intended to provide adequate time for users to transfer their accounts.
